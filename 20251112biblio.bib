	abstract = {Smoldering treatment is emerging as a valuable engineering tool for many processes, including food waste treatment. However, smoldering systems are currently not well-understood nor optimized. Therefore, numerical models provide invaluable insight into the process dynamics, which improves our understanding and supports the development of novel systems. These smoldering models couple heat, mass, and momentum transfer with pyrolysis and oxidation chemical reactions within porous media. While recent models have untangled many aspects of these systems, local oxygen transport rates from bulk flow to the fuel surface are still not well-resolved. In this work, local oxygen-transport equation was approximated by an analytic derivation based on the gas–solid oxygen non-equilibrium hypothesis. With the improved oxygen-transport equation, a 2D model with five-step reaction scheme for smoldering propagation of food waste in sand was developed. Kinetic parameters obtained from TG experiments were incorporated into the bed-scale smoldering propagation model. The developed model was validated with experimental data that stretched from robust to weak smoldering propagation. It was demonstrated that the developed model matches well with experiments. Furthermore, this model revealed: (i) the emergence of non-uniform gas flow in the reactor, (ii) the evolution of the kinetic- and oxygen-transportlimiting regimes, and (iii) valuable insight into the fundamental changes with smoldering robustness.},

	abstract = {Smoldering is the slow, low-temperature, and flameless burning of porous fuel and one of the most persistent types of combustion phenomena. The influence of cooling on the smoldering propagation and quenching is of practical significance but still poorly understood. In this work, a physics-based 2-D computational model that integrates heat and mass transfer and heterogeneous chemistry is built to investigate the limiting quenching conditions of in-depth smoldering propagation in a typical biomass sample. Simulation results predict that the smoldering quenching occurs as the sample width decreases or the wall-cooling coefficient increases, agreeing well with experiments. The modelled minimum smoldering temperature is about 350 oC, and minimum propagation rate is around 0.5 cm/h. Further analysis demonstrates that either the smoldering temperature or propagation rate increases with the sample width and eventually approaches it maximum value. Finally, the influences of the ambient temperature and oxygen level on the smoldering quenching distance are explored. This is the first time to use a comprehensive physics-based model to predict the quenching behavior of smoldering, which provides a deeper understanding of the persistence and extinction limit of smoldering fire phenomena.},

	abstract = {Applied smoldering has been demonstrated as an efficient waste-to-energy approach for low heating value/high moisture content combustible waste materials. Therefore, smoldering can be used to extract energy from wastes that are not amenable to traditional thermochemical routes (e.g., using flaming-based incinerators). Nevertheless, understanding the process of smoldering-driven drying and its relationship to ignition and quenching within these smoldering systems is critical to determine the viability and economic feasibility of this approach. These interlinked phenomena are not well-understood. To address this knowledge gap, this study developed new analytical methods with a previous validated numerical model to establish a comprehensive framework to better understand ignition and the associated drying process. These new models accurately resolve the coupling between downward water migration, water phase change, and smoldering propagation in space and time, revealing how drying defines ignition. The relationship between residual water saturation (Sw,r) and drying time to enable ignition (tdry,h) was determined analytically to unveil the fundamental relationships between these variables. Sw,r represents a critical limiting water saturation for smoldering ignition, which was found to be solely dependent on material properties rather than operational conditions (e.g., initial water saturation or packing height). In contrast, tdry,h, is the critical drying time that enables ignition, which was shown to be significantly influenced by system heat losses and operational parameters. Conditions such as a slender reactor design, insufficient thermal insulation, and low heater power can substantially extend the required drying period – and lead to ignition failure at critical conditions. Furthermore, a four-zone ignition region was established and used to characterize the requirements for smoldering ignition. Overall, this study untangles interlinked phenomena and supports researchers and engineers in better understanding drying and its influence on ignition within applied smoldering systems.},

	abstract = {Smouldering is a low-temperature, flameless, and persistent combustion process driven by heterogeneous oxidations. Oxygen supply is a key parameter of smouldering and is sensitive to fuel density and particle size, but our understanding is still limited. Herein, we explore the oxygen threshold for smouldering propagation under upward internal airflow velocities up to 5 mm/s. Pine needles with different bulk densities (55–120 kg/m3) and wood samples with different particle sizes (1–50 mm) are tested. We found that the minimum airflow velocity for sustaining smouldering propagation increases with the decrease of the bulk density or the increase of the particle size. By increasing the airflow velocity, the smouldering front first propagates unidirectionally (opposed) and then bidirectionally (opposed + forward). Nevertheless, when the pore size is large (the fuel particle size is large or the fuel bulk density is small), bidirectional propagation always occurs, because the oxygen can leak through the opposed smouldering front. A simplified thermochemical analysis is proposed to reveal the influence of interparticle heat transfer on the minimum oxygen supply rate of smouldering propagation. This work advances the fundamental understanding of smouldering on solid fuel particles and their smouldering fire risks and helps optimize the efficiency and safety of smouldering processes.},

Simulation results revealed that, the required oxidizer flow velocity or oxygen supply rate increased as the oxygen concentration decreased, and the predicted limiting oxygen concentration (LOC) was about 3 \%, agreeing well with the experimental observations and theoretical analysis. Moreover, the required airflow velocity was predicted to increase as the fuel density and environmental temperature decreased, or the moisture content increased, and the predicted maximum moisture content capable of supporting smoldering was about 110 \%. At the smothering limit, the modeled minimum smoldering temperature and propagation rate were around 300 ◦C and 0.5 cm/h.

	abstract = {Chemical and thermal nonequilibria between gas and solid phases conceptualize important physics for reactive transport in porous media such as smoldering combustion, which shapes the governing equations for mass and energy in studied system. Yet, it remains a challenging task for modelling gas-solid oxidant (oxygen) nonequilibrium and understanding its cause and effect. In this work, model of oxygen and thermal nonequilibria was developed for reverse smoldering combustion wave. Particularly, a simple approach with one oxygen species transport equation and modified sink/source terms associated with oxidative reactions for mass/energy conservation equations was used to address challenging oxygen nonequilibrium. The developed model was validated by experiments with two variables of fuels and injected air flow velocity under diverse conditions. Results showed that the developed model well predicted peak temperatures and spread rates of reverse combustion waves for all experiments. A two-dimensional layered structure of ahead evaporation front followed by pyrolysis front tailed with oxidation front was found in reverse combustion wave. Moreover, stratified kinetic and oxygentransport limiting regimes were observed for almost all local oxidation fronts in studied cases. The global limiting regime of oxygen transport determined by a holistic view of local limiting regimes agreed well with experimental observations. It revealed that the stratified local limiting regimes of heterogeneous kinetics and oxygen transport mainly resulted from gas-solid oxygen nonequilibrium. This work proved that the proposed model can be useful for predicting reverse smoldering combustion wave and improving our understanding of oxygen-nonequilibrium induced tempo-spatial evolution of the limiting regimes for reactive transport in porous media.},

Neither thermal nor chemical equilibrium between solid and gas phases is assumed. The more important extensions made to the original model are: radiation heat transfer is included, a new ignition process is implemented and the porous structure of the solid is reconsidered. The extensions to the original model were implemented in order to predict the experimental data. The model with its extensions has been calibrated at a higher inlet air velocity and validated. The results show that the model predicts reasonably well the velocity of propagation of the smoldering front.},

However, the StF transition mechanism under a variable-speed wind (VSW) remains to be explained. In this work, a onedimensional model for the StF transition of a biomass stick was developed, which was successfully validated against the experimental results in the literature. VSW was defined as a sinusoidal function of constant-speed wind (CSW) in this work. Then, the StF transition behaviors under a CSW and a VSW were compared. It was found that the transition time under VSW is, on average, 1.9 times greater than that under CSW due to its minor heat generation. Moreover, the transition behaviors under VSW with different periods and initial wind speeds were also investigated. For VSW with different periods, the StF transition at a low wind speed (1.5 {\textasciitilde} 3.7 m s 1) is mainly controlled by cooling, while by oxygen supply at a high wind speed (3.7 {\textasciitilde} 5 m s 1). The effect of the initial wind speed on heat loss is insignificant, but a higher initial wind speed gives a higher heat generation, resulting in a decrease in the transition time.},

We first validate the model against a shallow-reactor experiment (of 1.6 cm thickness) in the literature. Based on the validated model, we then investigate 2D smouldering in a 3 times deeper peat layer at different soil conditions. We found that lateral and in-depth spread rates depend on the organic density and the Oxygen supply. Because of the larger Oxygen supply close to the free surface, the lateral spread is 10 times faster than in-depth spread. In addition, for lateral spread the influence of inorganic density and moisture can be explained by a unified parameter, heat sink density, agreeing with previous experimental results. The model predicts the effects of peat conditions on multidimensional smouldering spread and reveals the controlling mechanisms both lateral and in-depth spread, providing a better understanding of this complex phenomenon.},

Peat smouldering is a slow, low-temperature combustion process significantly influenced by moisture content. This study investigates the combined effects of moisture levels and wind conditions on smouldering dynamics in peat. Experiments were conducted using a controlled combustion box with peat specimens containing peat soil and varying moisture contents, 5 \%, 50 \%, 100 \%, 150 \% and 200 \%. Results showed that low moisture content (5 \%) produced a maximum temperature of 620 ◦C, while high moisture (200 \%) limited combustion to just 38 ◦C. The rate of peat fire propagation was assessed by estimating the time interval at which the combustion temperature attained the smouldering point of 250 ◦C. The spread rates became progressively more susceptible to wind influence while decreasing with higher moisture content and greater bulk density. Overall, the smouldering spread rate increased with wind speed but decreased with higher moisture content and deeper burning layers. These findings provide valuable insights into the behaviour of peat combustion under varying environmental conditions and support the development of more effective fire prevention and mitigation strategies in tropical peatlands, especially in Malaysia.},

	abstract = {Smouldering combustion is an important and complex phenomenon that is central to a wide range of problems (hazards) and solutions (applications). A rich history of research in the context of ﬁre safety has yet to be integrated with the more recent, rapidly growing body of work in engineered smouldering solutions. The variety of disciplines, materials involved, and perspectives on smouldering have resulted in a lack of unity in the expression of key concepts, terminology used, interpretation of results, and conclusions extracted. This review brings together theoretical, experimental, and modelling studies across both ﬁre safety and applied smouldering research to produce a uniﬁed conceptual understanding of smouldering combustion. The review includes (i) an overview of the fundamental processes with a synthesis of nomenclature to generate a consistent set of terms for these fundamental processes, (ii) a distillation of ignition, extinction, and transition to ﬂaming research, (iii) a review of the temporal and spatial distribution of heat and mass transfer processes as well as their solution using analytical and numerical methods, (iv) an overview of smouldering emissions and emission treatment systems, and (v) a summary of key gaps and opportunities for future research. Beyond merely review, a new conceptual model is provided that articulates similarities and critical differences between the two main smouldering systems: porous solid fuels and condensed fuels in inert porous media. A quantitative analysis of this conceptual model reveals that the evolution of a smouldering front, while a local process, is determined by a global energy balance that is cumulative in time and has to be integrated in space. As such, the fate of a smouldering reaction can be predicted before the effects of global heat exchange have impacted the reaction. This approach is relevant to all forms of smouldering (including ﬁre safety), but it is particularly important when using smouldering as an engineered process that results in the positive use of the energy released by the smouldering reaction (applied smouldering). In applied smouldering, predicting the fate of a reaction ahead of time allows operators to modify the conditions of the process to maintain self-sustained smouldering propagation and thus fully harness the beneﬁts of the reaction.},

	abstract = {As a new technique, smoldering combustion has enormous potential for efficient disposal of high moisture content organic solid waste. Nevertheless, little is known about the smoldering kinetics and how effectively this technology adapts to various fuels. In this work, smoldering experiments were performed on municipal sludge (MS), electroplating sludge (ES), and dyeing sludge (DS), respectively, and the smoldering propagation behaviors were evaluated under various airflow rates. The applicability of conventional non-isothermal fitting method (NFM) and smoldering isothermal fitting method (SIFM) for calculating the smoldering intrinsic kinetic parameters were compared in conjunction with TG tests. The experimental results revealed that as the airflow rate increases, the smoldering temperature (Tp), smoldering velocity (us), and mass loss rate (rs) increase as well. Kinetic analyses reveal that, while both the Kissinger and Coats-Redfern methods have high fitted correlation coefficients, the use of non-isothermal TG experiments could not account for the porous medium conditions and the high rate of temperature increase in which the smoldering reaction occurs, and the resulting kinetic parameters are not representative. The activation energies of the three sludges obtained by SIFM are 107.17 kJ/ mol, 45.41 kJ/mol, and 156.96 kJ/mol, respectively, which are substituted into the AEA model, and it is discovered that the estimated SIFM values are consistent with the experimental values.},

	abstract = {Smouldering combustion is emerging as a valuable tool for energy conversion purposes. However, the effects of radial/lateral heat losses, while critical to its viability, are not well understood. It is known that heat losses weaken the smouldering reaction near the walls. It is less known that these losses generate non-uniform air ﬂux across the system cross-section, potentially changing conversion rates and quenching limits. This study integrated: (i) highly instrumented smouldering experiments across numerous scales, (ii) a novel method of estimating non-uniform air ﬂux in the experiments, (iii) analytical modelling to predict non-uniform cooling, and (iv) energy balance calculations to quantify the non-uniform heat of smouldering. Altogether, this work demonstrates that heat loss-induced non-uniform air ﬂux is signiﬁcant, affecting key smouldering propagation and cooling characteristics. The uniform air ﬂux injected at the base became redistributed with a {\textasciitilde}50\% decrease at the centreline and a {\textasciitilde}50\% increase at the wall. This was shown to cause a concave (in the direction of air ﬂow) smouldering front and a concave cooling front. The former was shown to cause radial heat transfer inwards, leading to super-adiabatic heating towards the centre of the reactor. The latter was shown to inhibit cooling along the centreline, which progressed {\textasciitilde}40\% slower than expected during propagation. Altogether, the multiple and integrated analyses used reveal the magnitude and signiﬁcance of heat losses in smouldering systems. This insight is valuable to better harness smouldering for engineering applications.},

While many applied smouldering systems rely on small fractions of fuel mixed within inert porous media (IPM) like coarse grain silica sand, there is also an opportunity to pursue co-waste management with much higher fuel loadings. This study explores these co-waste systems by blending nonsmoulderable wastes (e.g., sewage sludge) with smoulderable wastes (e.g., construction waste woodchips) to form porous solid fuels (PSFs). Key differences between these IPM and PSF systems were identified by contrasting the temperature profiles in space and time, specific mass loss rates, and emissions profiles across experiments in multiple reactors (with 0.054, 0.080, and 0.300 m radii). For example, the PSF systems exhibited higher throughputs, a more straightforward path towards continuous operation, improved scalability, and higher production of potentially useful by-products (e.g., CH4, H2) than the IPM systems. However, the PSF systems were more sensitive to extinction and exhibited lower fuel moisture content limitations than the IPM systems. Altogether, this study illuminates the benefits and trade-offs of co-waste smouldering.},

	abstract = {As applied smouldering systems gain popularity for a variety of energy conversion purposes, there is a strong interest in optimizing the reactor design to support robust smouldering. Heat losses play a critical role in the energy balance of smouldering systems, and therefore have strong implications toward understanding propagation limits and reactor design. Heat losses in an applied smouldering system were approximated by adapting the analytical model from Kuznetsov (1996), originally developed for unsteady local thermal non-equilibrium heat transfer in a porous cylinder, to simulate the cooling zone trailing the smouldering front. The analytical model was adapted to a smouldering system by solving on a domain that lengthens as the cooling zone expands at the rate of the smouldering velocity. The results are incorporated into a global energy balance on the smouldering system, thereby providing an inexpensive and rapid method to estimate the system energy eﬃciency. Conﬁdence in the analytical model was provided by demonstrating its predictions compare well with existing experimental and numerical estimates of heat losses from similar smouldering systems. The model was then used to quantify the sensitivity of the heat losses to two key reactor design parameters: radius and insulation quality. The system energy eﬃciency was shown to be highly sensitive to improved insulation and increased radius up to {\textasciitilde}0.1 m (i.e., laboratory-sized reactors). However, this sensitivity diminished with size. Beyond 0.4 m radius, the predicted system energy eﬃciency was high ({\textasciitilde}85-95\%) and relatively insensitive to reactor radius and insulation quality. Therefore, commercial, batch treatment smouldering reactors do not need to be larger than 0.4 m in radius to protect against heat losses and maximize their energy eﬃciency. This threshold design radius is considerably less than used in current reactors and therefore can provide valuable cost savings.},

	abstract = {Managing biosolids, the major by-product from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), persists as a widespread challenge that often constitutes the majority of WWTP operating costs. Self-sustained smouldering combustion is a new approach for organic waste treatment, in which the waste – the combustion fuel – is destroyed in an energy efﬁcient manner after mixing it with sand. Smouldering has never been applied to biosolids. Column experiments, using biosolids obtained from a WWTP, were employed to identify if, and under what conditions, smouldering could be used for treating biosolids. The parameter space in which smouldering was self-sustaining was mapped as a function of key system metrics: (1) sand/biosolids mass fraction, (2) biosolids moisture content, and (3) forced air ﬂux. It was found that a self-sustaining reaction is achievable using biosolids with water content as high as 80\% (with a biosolids lower heating value greater than 1.6 kJ/g). Moreover, results suggest that operator-controlled air ﬂux can assist in keeping the reaction self-sustaining in response to ﬂuctuations in biosolids properties. This proof-of-concept demonstrates the potential for smouldering as a new energy efﬁcient biosolids disposal method for very wet (i.e., minimally processed) biosolids that may offer WWTPs signiﬁcant operating cost savings. This study emphasizes smouldering’s usefulness as a novel waste management technique. Ó 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Smouldering combustion is the driving phenomenon of wildﬁre in peatlands, like those causing haze episodes in Southeast Asia and Northeast Europe. These are the largest ﬁres on Earth and an extensive source of greenhouse gases, but poorly understood, becoming an emerging research topic in climate-change mitigation. In this work, a series of multistep heterogeneous kinetics are investigated to describe the drying and decomposition in smouldering combustion of peat. The decomposition schemes cover a range of complexity, including 2, 3 or 4-step schemes, and up to 4 solid pseudo-species. The schemes aim to describe the simultaneous pyrolysis and oxidation reactions in smouldering ﬁres. The reaction rates are expressed by Arrhenius law, and a lumped model of mass loss is used to simulate the degradation behaviour seen during thermogravimetric (TG) experiments in both nitrogen and air atmospheres. A genetic algorithm is applied to solve the corresponding inverse problem using TG data from the literature, and ﬁnd the best kinetic and stoichiometric parameters for four types of boreal peat from different geographical locations (North China, Scotland and Siberia). The results show that at the TG level, all proposed schemes seem to perform well, with a high degree of agreement resulting from the forced optimization in the inverse problem approach. The chemical validity of the schemes is then investigated outside the TG realm and incorporated into a 1-D plug-ﬂow model to study the reaction and the species distribution inside a peat smouldering front. Both lateral and in-depth spread modes are considered. The results show that the drying sub-front is essential, and that the best kinetics is the 4-step decomposition (one pyrolysis, and three oxidations) plus 1-step drying with 5 condensed species (water, peat, a-char, b-char, and ash). This is the ﬁrst time that the smouldering kinetics and the reaction-zone structure of a peat ﬁre are explained and predicted, thus helping to understand this important natural and widespread phenomenon.},

Mathematical analogue models are those that are based on some mathematical conceit (rather than a physical representation of ﬁre spread) that coincidentally simulates the spread of ﬁre. Other papers in the series review models of an physical or quasi-physical nature and empirical or quasiempirical nature. Many models are extensions or reﬁnements of models developed before 1990.

This study investigates the influence of the wind angle, ranging from 𝜃଴ = 0° (concurrent smoldering spread) to 𝜃଴ = 180° (opposed smoldering spread), which is defined as the angle between the directions of the forced airflow and the reaction propagation, on blowoff limit and smoldering spread rate of 2.5 mm incense sticks using a rotating apparatus. The experimental results indicate an increase in smoldering rates and blow-off wind velocity as 𝜃଴ decreases. The maximum average smoldering rate is about 2.5 cm/min at 𝜃଴ = 0°, while it is less than 1 cm/min at 𝜃଴ = 180°. The blow-off wind velocity is 15 m/s at 𝜃଴ = 0° and 5 m/s at 𝜃଴ = 180°. The blow-off limit was discussed based on Damköhler number (Da). A simplified heat transfer analysis, coupled with computational fluid dynamics simulation, was used to calculate the smoldering rate. The simple model captures the experimental trend of the increasing smoldering rate at low wind velocity. A higher smoldering temperature results in a higher smoldering rate. Additionally, the higher smoldering rate observed at 𝜃଴ = 0° was reproduced, emphasizing the significant role of heat transfer. To maintain a steady smoldering rate, all the heat produced by the reactions must be removed, which occurs most efficiently at 𝜃଴ = 0°, leading to the highest smoldering rate.},

	abstract = {Improving the absorbed gas to active desorption and seepage and delaying gas drainage attenuation are considered as key methods for increasing drainage efﬁciency and gas output. According to the solid mechanics theory, the nonlinear Darcy seepage theory and thermodynamics, the heat–ﬂuid–solid coupling model for gassy coal has been improved. The numerical model was founded from the improved multi-ﬁeld coupling model by COMSOL Multiphysics and gas drainage by borehole down the coal seam enhanced by heat injection was modelled. The results show that the heat–ﬂuid–solid model with adsorption effects for gassy coal was well simulated by the improved multi-ﬁeld model. The mechanism of coal seam gas desorption seepage under the combined action of temperature, stress and adsorption can be well described. Gas desorption and seepage can be enhanced by heat injection into coal seams. The gas drainage rate was directly proportional to the temperature of injected heat in the scope of 30–150 °C and increasing in the whole modelled drainage process (0–1000 d). The increased level was maximum in the initial drainage time and decreasing gradually along with drainage time. The increasing ratio of drainage rate was maximum when the temperature raised from 30 to 60 °C. Although the drainage rate would increase along with increasing temperature, when exceeding 60 °C, the increasing ratio of drainage rate with rising temperature would decrease. Gas drainage promotion was more effective in coal seams with lower permeability than with higher permeability. The coal seam temperature in a 5 m distance surrounding the heat injection borehole would rise to around 60 °C in 3 months. That was much less than the time of gas drainage in the coal mines in sites with low permeability coal seams. Therefore, it is valuable and feasible to inject heat into coal seams to promote gas drainage, and this has strong feasibility for coal seams with low permeability which are widespread in China.},
